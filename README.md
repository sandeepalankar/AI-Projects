# AI Projects

This is a collection of the projects I completed during my Artificial Intelligence course at UPenn. These projects cover a variety of topics, including rational and logical agents, informed and uninformed search, Markov Decision Processes, reinforcement learning, probabilities and language models, probabilistic reasoning and Bayes' Nets, Naive Bayes and Perceptrons, Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing.
